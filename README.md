My name's Stefano, I'm an Information Engineering PhD student at Fondazione Bruno Kessler ([E3DA research unit](https://e3da.fbk.eu/)). <br>

My main research interests are TinyML,Speech Technologies and Audio Processing, with some IoT spice on them, for flavour enhancements.
Generally speaking, I'd say I quite enjoy algorithms and everything computation related.
