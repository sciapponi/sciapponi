Hi! My name's Stefano, I'm an Information Engineering PhD student at Fondazione Bruno Kessler ([E3DA research unit](https://e3da.fbk.eu/)). <br>

My main research interests are Edge AI for Audio Processing and Conservation Technology. Generally speaking, I enjoy tackling real world problems from a computational point of view.
