ðŸ¤– **Stefano's Computational Playground**

Greetings! I'm Stefano, an Information Engineering PhD student at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (E3DA research unit). <br>
My main research interests are TinyML, Smart Cities, and Speech Processing, but I have a general passion for tinkering with algorithms.

I think you might find something interesting about these topics here.
